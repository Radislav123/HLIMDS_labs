This design using Qsys to build a multiprocessor system containing 4 processors. Each processor is in a subsystem, creating a hierarchy with four subsystems with a shared memory map, coordinated with pipeline bridges. This system demonstrates a solution for the classic Dining Philosophers&#8217; Problem and shows case how to use the Nios II Software Build Tools (SBT) to create, build, download, and view stdio output in a console for four applications, using shell scripts. </description><documentation><title>Cyclone 10 LP Multiprocessor Nios II System Reference Design User Guide</title><url>http://www.alterawiki.com/uploads/a/a9/Cyclone_10_LP_Multiprocessor_Nios_II_System_Reference_Design_User_Guide.pdf</url></documentation></platform>
